To run the CNAPP Dashboard project, the essential prerequisites are:

1. Node.js
Version: v14 or higher

node -v
This should return a version number, e.g., v14.17.0.
2. npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
npm: Comes bundled with Node.js. Used for managing project dependencies.
Version: npm v6 or higher, or yarn v1.22 or higher.
Purpose: npm or yarn is used to install project dependencies listed in the package.json file.
Installation:
npm: Installed automatically with Node.js.
yarn: Can be installed via npm:
bash
